# hello-world

Hi! My name is Jenniffer and I am completely new to programming. I am currently taking classes to learn the skills that I need to become a successful web developer. I am super excited to learn how to build and design websites; but my long-term goals are to eventually branch out into other fields, like maybe virtual reality or artificial intelligence. Right now it's baby steps while I learn the foundations of coding and all the various languages, but only time will tell what the future holds and in what direction my career will unfold.
